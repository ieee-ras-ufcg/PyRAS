    "2. **Speech Processing**\n",

    "    - If successful, adds the recognized text to a speech queue.\n",
    "4. Retrieve Speech (get_speech Method)\n",
    "    - Returns and removes the first recognized speech from the queue when `get_speech` is called;\n",
    "    - If no speech is available, returns an empty string `(\"\")`.\n",
    "4. **Stop Listening**\n",
    "    - Stops background listening when `stop_listening` is called;\n",
