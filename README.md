# 🐍🤖 Python Robotics Laboratory 

## 🔍 Overview

This repository is focused on exploring and learning robotics concepts with *Python*. It is composed of various *Jupyter Notebooks* which studies are developed using *NumPy* and *Plotly* for generating data and visually plotting the analysed models. Each notebook has documented text explaining the math behind the implementations and are usually inspired by an external source.

## ⚔️ Usage 

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ieee-ras-ufcg/PyRAS
    ```
2. Create a Python Virtual Enviroment (highly recommended);
3. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the *Jupyter Notebooks* and change the model parameters as you like.
